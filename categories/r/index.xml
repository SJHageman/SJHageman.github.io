      <description>Monte-Carlo-Economy   The goal of this project is to simulate wealth distribution of a closed economy. It originally was written in c++ for a computational physics course, but has since been moved over to python. It is purely to satisfy my own curiosity. It follows from the work done by Patricia, et al. where they develop an analytical form of a non-Gibbs wealth distribution.
The idea is to use a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to generate a wealth distribution from an arbitrary inital state.</description>

      <description>Formspree makes it easy to receive submissions from HTML forms on your static website.      Functional Form     This theme has a form-to-email feature built in, thanks to the simple Formspree integration. All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form (/content/forms/contact.md). Of course, the example shown below (your@email.here) must not be used.</description>
